Gameplay
Now, it is time to run the game.

Create a list: ['0', '1', '2'] and store it in the variable called valid_entries, i.e, valid_entries = ['0', '1', '2'].

Create an infinite while loop. Inside the loop, create a variable called user_input to store the input taken by the player.

Use the input() function to take input from a player. Inside the input() function, write the Enter 0 for ROCK, 1 for PAPER and 2 for SCISSORS:
statement to show it as a message to a player.

Write another while loop to check whether the input provided by a player exists in the valid_entries list or not.

If the input provided by a player does not exist in the valid_entries list, then print Invalid Input! message. In the next line, rewrite the 
user_input = input("Enter 0 for ROCK, 1 for PAPER and 2 for SCISSORS: ") statement.

Now, outside the inner while loop, convert the user_input value to an integer value using the int() function.

Call the update_scores() function with the user_input as an input to update the scores of the computer and the player.

Call the update_counts() function with the user_input as an input to update the counts of the inputs provided by the player.

Write an if statement to check if the score is 10 for any of the player. If the comp_score == 10, then print the Computer Won! message and break the loop.
Else if the player_score == 10, then print the You won! message and break the loop.
