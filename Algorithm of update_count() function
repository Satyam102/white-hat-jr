Create The update_counts() Function
Now create a function and name it update_counts(). It should take user_input variable as input and update the count variables based on the following logic.

If the player plays ROCK (or user_input == 0), then increase the value of count_rock variable.

Else if the player plays PAPER (or user_input == 1), then increase the value of count_paper variable.

Else if the player plays SCISSORS (or user_input == 2), then increase the value of count_scissors variable.

The update_counts() function should not return anything. In other words, it should not contain the return statement. 
It should only perform the actions prescribed above. Make sure that you add the global keyword before the count_rock,
count_paper and count_scissors variables before incrementing their values. Without it you will face an error while running the game.
