The Algorithm

In the algorithm, the computer should keep a count of player moves (i.e., the counts for 0, 1 and 2) in three separate variables - count_rock, count_paper and count_scissors. 
The algorithm should decide the computer's move based on the following possibilities:

If the value of the count_rock variable is greater than the values of the count_paper and count_scissors variables, then the computer's move should be ROCK.

If the value of the count_paper variable is greater than the values of thecount_rock and count_scissors variables, then the computer's move should be PAPER.

If the value of the count_scissors variable is greater than the values of the count_rock and count_paper variables, then the computer's move should be SCISSORS.

In all other cases, the computer should play ROCK, PAPER and SCISSORS randomly.



Gameplay
In this game, you should maintain the scores for both - the player and the computer. The game should continue till either the player or the computer has reached a score of 10 points. At every move, the output should consist of the following:

The player move and the computer move.

The player score and the computer score.
